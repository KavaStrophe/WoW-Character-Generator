# Character generator for World of Warcraft

## Goal
This project has only one goal: allowing me to experiment some POO features of typescript & React.js

## TODO
 - Name generation: I will only implement a few name generators and a default name generator.
 - Randomized classes: I will implement a class generator that will combine keywords to create weird classes.
 - Automated portrait research: I will implement a function that will search on Google or other websites (depending of the CORS policy) to fetch a picture corresponding to the generated character.
 - Share function: I will allow people to share the generated character by using a seed in the URL to randomize the generation.
 - Interface: A simple interface not too ugly and some assets.
 - Document functions
 - Create unit tests for fun
 - More random features ?
